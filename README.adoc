= Advent of Code 2019

This repository contains my solution to 2019's https://adventofcode.com/2018[Advent of Code] puzzles in Go.

The easiest way to run these is using docker â€“ simply execute `run.sh &lt;day&gt;` to build a docker image and execute
the specific day.

I have separate repositories for solutions from previous years:
 - https://g.c5h.io/archive/aoc-2018[2018] (Nim)
 - https://g.c5h.io/archive/aoc-2017[2017] (Python)
 - https://g.c5h.io/archive/aoc-2016[2016] (Python)
 - https://g.c5h.io/archive/aoc-2015[2015] (Python)
